		<p>TechDiversity is a website for persons belonging to underrepresented groups in the technology industry. Members of minority groups can come here to find out about opportunities that are targetted towards underrepresented groups, but will also include general opportunities. These opportunities will include scholarships, internships, research opportunities, conferences, etc. 
		
		<p>Users will be able to create an account, fill out their profile (particularly regarding the underrepresented group/s to which they belong). They will then be able to sign up for notifications when new opportunities matching their profiles are posted, when applications open and when deadlines are approaching. Users will also be able to share opportunities with others.</p>
		
		<p>The idea is, you can't take advantage of opportunities if you do not know they exist. It will allow more persons to utilize the resources provided for them and in the long run lead to a more diverse industry.</p>
